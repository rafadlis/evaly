## Implementation Notes

- The implementation fetches all sections, attempts, user information, and answers for a specific test.
- It calculates scores and ranks for each submission based on correct answers.
- Submissions are sorted by score in descending order.
- Section-specific data is provided for detailed analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE) could be implemented in the future.
- Pagination for large datasets.
- Filtering and sorting options on the server side.
